BACKEND:
   Backend is a server-side program that handles requests, applies logic, and manages data using a database.
 
🏠 House example

Frontend = Doorbell
Backend = Owner
Database = Cupboard

You don’t open cupboard directly.
You ring bell → owner decides → gives item.

WHY frontend should NOT talk to database directly

This is VERY important 👇

❌ If frontend connects directly:

Anyone can see DB details
Anyone can steal / delete data
Zero security

✅ Backend acts as gatekeeper

Hides database
Controls access
Applies rules

👉 Backend = security + control


🔥 What is an API?
	API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules that allows one program (frontend) to request data or actions from another program (backend).
